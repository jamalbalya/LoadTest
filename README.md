# LoadTest

In this code, you would replace the url variable with the URL of the web server you want to test, 
and the num_requests and request_delay variables with the number of requests you want to send and the delay between requests in seconds, respectively.

The code sends num_requests GET requests to the specified URL with a delay of request_delay seconds between each request. 
For each request, it measures the response time and stores it in the response_times list. After all requests have been sent, it calculates and prints the average, maximum, and minimum response times.
